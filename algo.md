COGS in a machine

The idea:

Garbage men take out the trash keeping our neighborhoods clean, while mailmen deliver our products that we order. These tasks can be tedious and inefficient, especially if you need to hit multiple checkpoints at the same location

The solution that I propose we could use is the short path finding algorithm.

This algorithm will allow mailmen and garbage men to most efficiently hit every checkpoint they need to hit, we can also put priority checkpoints. 

dijkstra algorithm will provide the shortest route, and allow our mailmen and garbage men too move more efficiently throughout the city that they desire, 

with my interface they can add garbage cans and mailboxes (nodes) that they need to visit, once they add all the nodes they can run the algorithm, finding the shortest route they need for each node
